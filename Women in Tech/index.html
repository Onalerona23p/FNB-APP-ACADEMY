            <p>I am thrilled to see women breaking through barriers in the Tech World. In this month as we celebrate women. 
                This is dedicated to women who inspire me to learn,grow and build in the world of Technology</p>
                <p>I acknowledge their dedication to all the young girls and women who are inspired by the world of Technology.<br> These women help promote diversity through mentorships and help build in disadvantaged
                    communities. This drives to innovation in including women in the tech world. It closes the gender gap and empowering women.
