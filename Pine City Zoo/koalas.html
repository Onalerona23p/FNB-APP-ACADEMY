				<h3>KOALA</h3>
				<p>The Koala(Phascolarctos cinereus or inaccurately,koala bear) is an arboreal herbivorous
					marsupial native to Australia. It is the extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae
					and its closest living relatives are wombats. The Koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's
					eastern and southern regions,inhabiting Queensland
					,New South Wales,Victoria,and South Australia.</p>
				<p>It is easily recognisable by its stout tailess body and large head with round fluffy ears and
					large, spoon-shaped nose.The Koala has a body length of 60 to 85cm(24 to 33in)and
					weighs 4 to 25 kg (9 to 33lb).Pelage colour ranges from silver grey tp chocolate brown.
					Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than
					their counterparts further south. These population are separate aubspecies, but this is disputed.
				</p>
				<p>Koalas have very few natural predators and parasites,but are threatened by various pathogens
					,such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus, as well as by bushfires and droughts.</p>
				<p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p>
				<p>You will find the Koalas next to the Giraffe enclosure</p>
