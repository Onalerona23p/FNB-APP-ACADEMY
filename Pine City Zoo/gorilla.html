				<h3>GORILLA</h3>
				<p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling ,predominantly herbivorous apes the inhabit the forest of
					central Africa. The eponymous genus Gorilla is devided into two species; the eastern Gorillasand the
					western gorillas,and either
					four or five subspecies. They are the largest living primates by physical size. The DNA of Gorillas
					is highly similar
					to that of humans, from 95% to 99% depending on what is counted ,they are the nextclosest living
					relatives to humans
					after the Chimpanzees and bonobos.</p>
				<p>Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forests in Africa. Although their range
					covers small percentage of Africa, gorillas cover a wild range
					of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of Virunga
					Volcanoes,
					ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres. Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland
					swamps and marshes
					as low as sea level with western lowland gorillas living in Central West African coutries and
					eastern lowland gorillas living in Democratic Republic of Congo near its border
					Rwanda
