				<h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
				<p> The Giraffe(Giraffa camelopardalis)is an African even-toed ungulate mammal,
					the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant.Its species name refers to its
					camel-like shape
					and its leopard-like colouring. Its chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely
					long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its classified under the family Giraffadae,
					along with its closest extant relative,the okapi.The nine subspecies aew distinguished by
					their coat patterns.</p>
				<p>Giraffes are preyed on only lions;their calves are also targetted by leopards,spotted hyenas and
					African wild
					dogs.Adult Giraffes do not have strong social bonds though they do gather in loose aggregations
					if they happen to be moving in the same general direction males establish social hierchies
					through"necking" which are combat bouts where the neck is used
					as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access for raising the young.</p>
